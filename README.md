# OpenShift etcd backup CronJob

This CronJob creates an POD which runs `/usr/local/bin/cluster-backup.sh` on a master-node to create the described backup. After finishing, it copies the files to an configured PV and expires old backups according to its configuration.

The OpenShift 4 backup generates 2 different files with the date when it is performed:

- snapshot_TIMESTAMP.db
- static_kuberesources_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz

The `.db` file is a snapshot of the etcd and the archived `.tar.gz` contains the static pods of the control plane (etcd, api server, controller manager and scheduler) with their respective certificates and private keys. Those files are put in a separate directory on the PV per backup run.

## Installation

First, create a namespace:
```
oc new-project etcd-backup
```

Since the container needs to be privileged, add the reqired RBAC rules:
```
oc create -f backup-rbac.yaml
```

Then adjust the storage configuration to your needs in `backup-storage.yaml` and deploy it. The example uses NFS but you can use any storage class you want:
```
oc create -f backup-storage.yaml
```

Configure the backup-script:
```
oc create -f backup-config.yaml
```

Then deploy, and configure the cronjob:
```
oc create -f backup-cronjob.yaml
```

## Creating manual backup / testing

To test the backup, or create an manual backup, you can run a job:
```
backupName=$(date "+etcd-backup-manual-%F-%H-%M-%S")
oc create job --from=cronjob/etcd-backup ${backupName}
```

To see if everything works as it should, you can check the logs:
```
oc logs -l job-name=${backupName}
```
Then check on your Storage, if the files are there as excepted.

## Configuration

Configuration can be changed in configmap `backup-config`:

```
oc edit -n etcd-backup cm/backup-config
```

The following options are used:
- `OCP_BACKUP_SUBDIR`: Sub directory on PVC that should be used to store the backup. If it does not exist it will be created.
- `OCP_BACKUP_DIRNAME`: Directory name for a single backup. This is a format string used by
[`date`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html)
- `OCP_BACKUP_EXPIRE_TYPE`:
  - `days`: Keep backups newer than `backup.keepdays`.
  - `count`: Keep a number of backups. `backup.keepcount` is used to determine how much.
  - `never`: Dont expire backups, keep all of them.
- `OCP_BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS`: Days to keep the backup. Only used if `backup.expiretype` is set to `days`
- `OCP_BACKUP_KEEP_COUNT`: Number of backups to keep. Only used if `backup.expiretype` is set to `count`
- `OCP_BACKUP_UMASK`: Umask used inside the script to set restrictive permission on written files, as they contain sensitive information.

Changing the schedule be done in the CronJob directly, with `spec.schedule`:
```
oc edit -n etcd-backup cronjob/etcd-backup
```
Default is `0 0 * * *` which means the cronjob runs one time a day at midnight.

## Monitoring

To be able to get alerts when backups are failing or not being scheduled you can deploy this [PrometheusRule](https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/openshift-etcd-backup/etcd-backup-cronjob-monitor.PrometheusRule.yaml).

```
oc create -n etcd-backup -f etcd-backup-cronjob-monitor.PrometheusRule.yaml
```

# Helm chart

To easily deploy the solution a helm chart is available on upstream Adfinis charts [repository](https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/openshift-etcd-backup).

## Installation

Before installing the chart, feel free to update the `values.yaml` file according to your needs.

```
helm repo add adfinis https://charts.adfinis.com
helm install etcd-backup adfinis/openshift-etcd-backup
```

## Development

### Release Management

The CI/CD setup uses semantic commit messages following the
[conventional commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
There is a GitHub Action in [.github/workflows/semantic-release.yaml](./.github/workflows/semantic-release.yaml)
that uses [go-semantic-commit](https://go-semantic-release.xyz/) to create new releases.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```console
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

1. **fix:** a commit of the type `fix` patches gets released with a PATCH version bump
1. **feat:** a commit of the type `feat` gets released as a MINOR version bump
1. **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:` gets released as a MAJOR version bump
1. types other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed and don't trigger a release

If a commit does not contain a conventional commit style message you can fix
it during the squash and merge operation on the PR.
